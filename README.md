## Features
- Import dictionary with keywords or generate dictionary according to keywords specified by user.
-  Monitor web traffic using mitmproxy. 
-  Scan asynchronously every searched website (no delay appeared because services work independently).
-  Mitmporxy server sends URL (with html content) to the Web Scanner service that check the content and determine if site will be blocked or not.
-  Another service (key logger service) check if your currently searching words has similarity with the website that is blocked and provide logs if so.
-  All searched websites are saved in Redis cache. 
-  Redis is running on docker.
-  User can manually change the status of website: blocked, visited, exception.
-  Statistics are saved on Redis (number of times the website has been opened)
-  User can see the statistics graph (determined most searched pages)
